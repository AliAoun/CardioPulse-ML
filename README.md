# CardioPulse: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction through an Integrated Machine Learning Framework ‚ù§Ô∏èü©∫

## Overview
**CardioPulse** is an Android application designed to predict cardiovascular diseases using machine learning algorithms. Developed as a Final Year Project (FYP) by students from the University of Sialkot, Faculty of Computing and IT, under the guidance of our project advisor.

The app integrates predictive modeling, secure cloud storage via Firebase, and provides users with personalized cardiovascular health assessments. Our goal is to contribute to global health by leveraging modern technology for early detection of heart-related diseases.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: v4.2+ (for development)
- **Java JDK**: 8 or above
- **Firebase**: Setup for cloud storage
- **Google Colab**: For training and exporting machine learning models
- **Python**: v3.8+ (for model training with TensorFlow and scikit-learn)
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For model deployment on mobile
- **Git**: For version control

### Steps
1. **Clone Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliAoun/CardioPulse-ML.git` 

2.  **Setup Firebase**
    
    -   Create a Firebase project.
    -   Download `google-services.json` and place it in the `app/` directory.
    -   Enable Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, and Cloud Storage in your Firebase Console.
3.  **Run Machine Learning Model**
    
    -   Open the model training notebook in Google Colab.
    -   Install dependencies:
        
        `pip install scikit-learn tensorflow` 
        
    -   Train the model and export it as `.tflite`.
    -   Place the exported model in the Android project's `assets/` folder.
4.  **Build & Run the App**
    
    -   Open the project in Android Studio.
    -   Sync Gradle and run the app on an Android device or emulator.
